## Introduction

Human wellbeing, particularly mental health issues, are a huge societal problem that is often marginalised and neglected. Our group aims to explore suicide rates per state within the United States by examining problems stemming from the contemporary world. Some potential factors leading to mental health issues and subsequent suicide include unemployment, poverty, gender and income levels.

Having sourced 2 datasets about US Census Data per State and Suicide Rates per State, we will focus on comparing the years 2015 and 2017.

Some of the questions we wish to answer are:
* Does gender play a role in influencing suicide rates?
* Do differing unemployment levels per state have an impact on suicide rates?
* Does poverty lead to a greater likelihood of suicide?
* How does income influence suicide?
* Why are there differences in suicide trends between the years 2015 and 2017?

And so on...
