### 1.0 Introduction
1. **Problem Situation:**  
The stakeholders in the problem of suicide in the United States is everyone and especially those suffering with a mental illness. The setting of this problem stems from many factors of the contemporary world including unemployment, income, and poverty. Excess pressure from any of these categories can push someone into a depression and, depending on the course of events after that, lead to self harm or death. Up until recent years, mental health and treatment has been far from normalized so policies and ethics around it are still fairly new as children and adults seek treatment. This can pose a challenge that people do not feel extremely comfortable seeking help for their mental needs and can lead to many people suffering alone. Society and social media in the United States especially today rides on a key value of appearing as if life is perfect, flawless, and effortless; this can directly contribute to someone’s mental health and make them feel outcasted or ashamed if they feel different.
2. **What is the Problem?**  
The problem is the continuous rising of suicide rates in the United States and the disparities between the rates in each of the states. In addition, this exposes the problem with mental health care and intervention to those who have suicidal tendencies in the United States. Idaho has some of the highest rate growth from 1985-2015 while Nevada has gone down 1%.
3. **Why Does it Matter?**  
This matters because the trend of people committing suicide has been rising in the United States, this means more lives are being lost and could of been prevented. This also matters because it affects a lot of people around us and the country, especially in a stress-filled university like the UW. Moreover, preventing suicide will also promote positive energy in society and contribute to overall healthy growth for years to come.
4. **How it Will Be Addressed?**  
We will address this issue by proposing an education program implementation into schools across the United States to better educate, normalize, and help children, teens, and young adults about suicide, depression, and handling their mental health. This will help to lessen suicide attempts of young people and prepare the future generations of adults to seek help and spend time with their mental health issues. To help adults in the USA, we propose work time seminar that will teach and help the employees of companies about the importance of their mental health and what to do in crisis situations. Our goal is to start the conversation about the normality of mental health issues and remove their associated stigmas.

### 2.0 Research Questions
* **Research Question 1:**  
How do factors like unemployment rates, poverty percentages, and income contribute to each state’s suicide rate?
* **Research Question 2:**   
Between 2000 and 2015, what has been the trend of suicide rates for each state? Has it improved or worsened? If so, what sort of interventions and factors played a role?

### 3.0 Possible Data Sets
* **Data Set 1:** [US Suicides per State](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu?fbclid=IwAR0EQq89YTaLq7Icqp-mWrjT7fuokDmkascnVtTxqPVzpKRCMxL0R63IDik()  
The original data set comes from the National Centre For Health Statistics. In this dataset are the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999, with data being collected from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. The attributes inside the data frame include the 'Year' of death, '113 Cause Name' for details behind the death, 'Cause Name' for category of the death , the 'State' where this death occurred, the total number of cause-related 'Deaths' and deaths per 100,000 of the population in 'Age-adjusted Death Rates'. In our cleaned dataset *four_years_state_suicide*, we have the number of suicides for each state in the US for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. We have kept the attributes 'Year', ''

* Data Set 2: [US Census Demographic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data)
This data set was collected by the US Census Bureau. It examines the total population of the United States and breaks it down into ethnic and gender characteristics. It also examines factors such as income, poverty, and employment. These attributes provide a comprehensive overview of the situation in each county and state. In the county dataset, there are 3221 observations and 37 attributes.

### 4.0 Information Visualizations

### 5.0 Team Coordination
1. Meeting Times:
* Monday: 3:30pm - 6:30pm
* Tuesday: 9am - 10am (back up)
* Friday: 3:30 - 6:30 (back up)

2. Individual goal(s) for the project and your roles:

    Adrianna Mitalas: My goal for this project is to understand and analyze trends in the United States, find correlations between them, and apply them to my personal life and those around me. My role in the group is to organize our documents and make sure we are on track with progress.

    Betty Kao: My goal for this project is to understand the reasons for the increase in the suicide rate and I hope I can find out the solution to solve the issue. I believe I am a helper in our group. I can help my groupmate do whatever they need.

    Bobin Hu: I hope this project will build my skills in analyzing large data sets and presenting the information in an effective way. I also want to find out how suicide is linked to various social factors. My role will be collecting information from the Internet.

    William Yu: I wish to better understand the impact mental health has on individuals my age. The opportunity to work on such a dataset, analyse trends with industry-standard techniques and build a solid foundation would prove beneficial to my future technology career. My role in this group is to input ideas, double-check on completed work and collaborate with my fellow team members such that we can grow in a mutually supportive environment.

3. We are communicating weekly on messenger and in section

4. We will give feedback and will address challenges in person by discussing in a group what is best for the team.

### 6.0 Questions for Teaching Team
* How heavy will the workload for each part of the assignment be each week?
* Will there be a clear way to divide up each part of an assignment?
* How do we track changes in the repository, especially when there are multiple commits and pushes at the same time?
* What's the overall weighting of this assignment?
