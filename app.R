      and especially those suffering with a mental illness. The setting of this 
      problem stems from many factors of the contemporary world including unemployment, 
      income, and profession. Excess pressure from any of these categories can push 
      someone into a depression and, depending on the course of events after that, 
      lead to self harm or death. Up until recent years, mental health and treatment 
      has been far from normalized so policies and ethics around it are still fairly 
      new as children and adults seek treatment. This can pose a challenge that people 
      do not feel extremely comfortable seeking help for their mental needs and can lead 
      to many people suffering alone. Society and social media in the United States especially 
      today rides on a key value of appearing as if life is perfect, 
      flawless, and effortless; this can directly contribute to someoneâ€™s 
      mental health and make them feel outcasted or ashamed if they feel different."),

      and the disparities between the rates in each of the states.

      to those who have suicidal tendencies in the United States. Idaho has some of the
      highest rate growth from 1985-2015 while Nevada has gone down 1%."),

    p("This matters because the trend of people committing suicide 
      has been rising in the United States, this means more lives are being lost 
      and could of been prevented. This also matters because it affects a lot of people 
      around us and the country, especially in a stress-filled university like the UW. 
      Moreover, preventing suicide will also promote positive energy in society and contribute 
      to overall healthy growth for years to come."), 
    h3("4. How it Will Be Addressed?"),
    p("We will address this issue by proposing an education program implementation 
    into schools across the United States to better educate, normalize, and help children, 
    teens, and young adults about suicide, depression, and handling their mental health. 
    This will help to lessen suicide attempts of young people and prepare the future 
    generations of adults to seek help and spend time with their mental health issues. 
    To help adults in the USA, we propose work time seminar that will teach and help the
    employees of companies about the importance of their mental health and what to do in crisis situations."),
